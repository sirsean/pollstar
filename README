pollstar is an open source web app that lets you set up polls for other people to take, or to take other people's polls. Its aim is to be as simple as possible.

To set it up, you'll first need Mongo installed and running.

1. [Download Mongo](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Downloads)
2. Unpack it (unzip, tar, etc)
3. cd Downloads/mongodb-osx-x86_64-1.2.1 (or whatever the path is to the directory you just unpacked)
4. sudo mkdir /data && sudo chmod 777 /data && mkdir /data/db
5. bin/mongod

Your Mongo server is running! Now you'll need to install some gems:

    gem install mongo
    gem install mongo_mapper
    gem install sinatra
    gem install haml
    gem install pony

You'll also need to copy the configuration template and update it to your needs:

    cp config.yaml.template config.yaml

Note: This configuration file is REQUIRED!

Then you can run the server:

    ruby pollstar_server.rb

Go to http://localhost:4567/ to start making polls in your local environment!
